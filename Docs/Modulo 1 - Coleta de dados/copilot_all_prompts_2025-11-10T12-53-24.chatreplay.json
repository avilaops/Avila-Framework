Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI.

Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3.

If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1.

Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_microsoft\">\n# Microsoft Learn MCP Server\r\n\r\nThis server gives structured access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation via three tools:\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_search\r\nSearch official documentation and return up to 10 concise, high-quality content chunks (max 500 tokens each), including title, URL, and excerpt.\r\n\r\n- Use first to get a quick, reliable overview\r\n- Ideal for grounding answers in Microsoft knowledge\r\n\r\n### microsoft_code_sample_search\r\nSearch for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn documentation and return up to 20 relevant, high-quality code samples.\r\n\r\n- Use when you need to provide sample Microsoft/Azure related code in your answers.  \r\n- Ideal for generating code snippets or practical implementation examples.  \r\n- Optional parameter `language` can filter results. \r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_fetch\r\nFetch and convert full Microsoft documentation pages to markdown.\r\n\r\n- Use after search when you need full content from a specific URL\r\n- Required for detailed tutorials, troubleshooting, prerequisites, code samples, or when search results are incomplete or outdated\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI. Você pode otimizar seu prompt usando este código ou usar o otimizador [em nosso playground!](https://platform.openai.com/playground/prompts)\n\nPergunte ao ChatGPT\n\n**Estrutura do**  \nlivro de receitas Este caderno segue esta estrutura:\n\n- [Passo 1. Visão geral do sistema](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#1-system-overview) - Saiba como funciona o sistema de otimização imediata\n- [Etapa 2. Modelos de dados](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#2-data-models) - Entenda as estruturas de dados usadas pelo sistema\n- [Etapa 3. Definindo os agentes](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#3-defining-the-agents) - Veja os agentes que analisam e melhoram os prompts\n- [Etapa 4. Avaliações](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-using-evaluations-to-arrive-at-these-agents) - Use o Evals para verificar nossa escolha e instruções de modelo de agente\n- [Etapa 5. Executar fluxo de trabalho de otimização](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-run-optimization-workflow) - Veja como o fluxo de trabalho entrega os prompts\n- [Etapa 6. Exemplos](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#5-examples) - Explore exemplos reais de otimização imediata\n\n**Pré-requisitos**\n\n- O pacote Python `openai`\n- O pacote `openai-agents`\n- Uma chave de API OpenAI definida como em suas variáveis de ambiente `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n\n## 1\\. Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta. O fluxo de trabalho principal consiste em várias execuções dos agentes em paralelo para processar e otimizar prompts com eficiência.\n\n```\ndef _normalize_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n\n    \"\"\"Convert list of pydantic message models to JSON-serializable dicts.\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    for m in messages:\n\n        if hasattr(m, \"model_dump\"):\n\n            result.append(m.model_dump())\n\n        elif isinstance(m, dict) and \"role\" in m and \"content\" in m:\n\n            result.append({\"role\": str(m[\"role\"]), \"content\": str(m[\"content\"])})\n\n    return result\n\nasync def optimize_prompt_parallel(\n\n    developer_message: str,\n\n    messages: List[\"ChatMessage\"],\n\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Runs contradiction, format, and few-shot checkers in parallel,\n\n    then rewrites the prompt/examples if needed.\n\n    Returns a unified dict suitable for an API or endpoint.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with trace(\"optimize_prompt_workflow\"):\n\n        # 1.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Keep ≤10 best-res.\n\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n**Sample skeleton (minified):**\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n\n{\"name\":\"\",\"brand\":\"\",\"sku\":\"\",\"price\":{\"value\":0,\"currency\":\"USD\"},\"images\":[\"\"],\"sizes\":[],\"materials\":[],\"care_instructions\":\"\",\"features\":[]}\n\nNote: It is acceptable to output null for any missing field instead of an error ###\"\"\"\n\n    \n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Contradiction issues:\")\n\n        print(result[\"contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n        \n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_contradiction()\n```\n\n```\nContradiction issues:\nThere is a contradiction between the rule that says to short-circuit and output an error if *any* required field is missing ('{\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}') and the final note which states that it is acceptable to output null for any missing field instead of an error. Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3. Visible DOM fallback (class hints: \"product-name\", \"price\")\n\n**Rules:**  \n- If *any* required field is missing, short-circuit and output: \\`{\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\\`\n- Prices: Numeric with dot decimal; strip non-digits (e.g., \"1.299,00 EUR\" → 1299.00 + \"EUR\").\n- Deduplicate images differing only by query string. Keep ≤10 best-res.\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Successful Output: Emit a minified JSON object with the following fields and types (order not enforced):\n  - name: string\n  - brand: string\n  - sku: string\n  - price: object with:\n    - value: number\n    - currency: string\n  - images: array of string URLs\n  - sizes: array of strings (each including a unit tag, e.g., \"37 EU\")\n  - materials: array of strings\n  - care_instructions: string\n  - features: array of strings\n\nExample:\n{\"name\":\"Product Name\",\"brand\":\"Brand\",\"sku\":\"SKU123\",\"price\":{\"value\":1299.00,\"currency\":\"EUR\"},\"images\":[\"https://example.com/image1.jpg\",\"https://example.com/image2.jpg\"],\"sizes\":[\"37 EU\",\"38 EU\"],\"materials\":[\"Cotton\",\"Polyester\"],\"care_instructions\":\"Machine wash cold\",\"features\":[\"Feature 1\",\"Feature 2\"]}\n\n- If any required field is missing, return:\n  {\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\n  (Where <field> is the missing required field name.)\n```\n\nIsso demonstra como o sistema pode detectar e resolver contradições críticas que podem levar a saídas inconsistentes ou confusão para o modelo.\n\n### Exemplo 2: Corrigindo inconsistências entre exemplos de prompt e poucos disparos\n\n```\nasync def example_fewshot_fix():\n\n    prompt = \"Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).\"\n\n    \n\n    messages = [\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest US city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"New York City\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest UK city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\"city\\\":\\\"London\\\",\\\"population\\\":9541000}\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples before optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    print()\n\n    \n\n    # Call the optimization API\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [ChatMessage(**m) for m in messages])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Inconsistency found:\", result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    \n\n    # Show the optimized few-shot examples\n\n    optimized_messages = result[\"new_messages\"]\n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples after optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_fewshot_fix()\n```\n\n```\nFew-shot examples before optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: New York City\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n\nInconsistency found: The response 'New York City' does not use JSON format and is missing the required keys \\`city\\` and \\`population\\` as stated in the rule 'Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).'\n\nFew-shot examples after optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"New York City\",\"population\":8468000}\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n```\n\nThis is particularly important because few-shot examples have a strong influence on how models respond. If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n\n2. For each chunk:\n\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \"≥150 C\").\n\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI.

Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3.

If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1.

Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_microsoft\">\n# Microsoft Learn MCP Server\r\n\r\nThis server gives structured access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation via three tools:\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_search\r\nSearch official documentation and return up to 10 concise, high-quality content chunks (max 500 tokens each), including title, URL, and excerpt.\r\n\r\n- Use first to get a quick, reliable overview\r\n- Ideal for grounding answers in Microsoft knowledge\r\n\r\n### microsoft_code_sample_search\r\nSearch for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn documentation and return up to 20 relevant, high-quality code samples.\r\n\r\n- Use when you need to provide sample Microsoft/Azure related code in your answers.  \r\n- Ideal for generating code snippets or practical implementation examples.  \r\n- Optional parameter `language` can filter results. \r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_fetch\r\nFetch and convert full Microsoft documentation pages to markdown.\r\n\r\n- Use after search when you need full content from a specific URL\r\n- Required for detailed tutorials, troubleshooting, prerequisites, code samples, or when search results are incomplete or outdated\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1. Use `microsoft_docs_search` to find relevant documents.\r\n2. If you need code examples or practical snippets, use `microsoft_code_sample_search`.\r\n3. If deeper or complete information is needed, use `microsoft_docs_fetch`.\r\n\r\n**Search gives breadth. Code Sample Search gives practical examples. Fetch gives depth.**\r\n\r\nAll content comes from Microsoft Learn or official sources, returned in clean markdown format.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI. Você pode otimizar seu prompt usando este código ou usar o otimizador [em nosso playground!](https://platform.openai.com/playground/prompts)\n\nPergunte ao ChatGPT\n\n**Estrutura do**  \nlivro de receitas Este caderno segue esta estrutura:\n\n- [Passo 1.

Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta. O fluxo de trabalho principal consiste em várias execuções dos agentes em paralelo para processar e otimizar prompts com eficiência.\n\n```\ndef _normalize_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n\n    \"\"\"Convert list of pydantic message models to JSON-serializable dicts.\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    for m in messages:\n\n        if hasattr(m, \"model_dump\"):\n\n            result.append(m.model_dump())\n\n        elif isinstance(m, dict) and \"role\" in m and \"content\" in m:\n\n            result.append({\"role\": str(m[\"role\"]), \"content\": str(m[\"content\"])})\n\n    return result\n\nasync def optimize_prompt_parallel(\n\n    developer_message: str,\n\n    messages: List[\"ChatMessage\"],\n\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Runs contradiction, format, and few-shot checkers in parallel,\n\n    then rewrites the prompt/examples if needed.\n\n    Returns a unified dict suitable for an API or endpoint.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with trace(\"optimize_prompt_workflow\"):\n\n        # 1.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3.

If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n\n2. For each chunk:\n\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \"≥150 C\").\n\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

Vou criar um sistema que usa **apenas o Obsidian Vault** e ensina um **orquestrador (agente IA)** a fazer todo o trabalho de análise, limpeza e organização.\n\n## 🎯 **CONCEITO REVISADO**\n\nO sistema irá:\n1. **Treinar um agente orquestrador** que aprende com seus próprios arquivos\n2. **Auto-análise**: O agente lê e entende seu conhecimento\n3. **Auto-organização**: Categoriza, remove duplicatas, cria grafos\n4. **Auto-atualização**: Gera prompts contextuais que evoluem com seu vault\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ **ARQUITETURA SIMPLIFICADA**\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│     OBSIDIAN VAULT (Única Fonte)       │\n└────────────────┬────────────────────────┘\n                 │\n        ┌────────▼────────┐\n        │  ORQUESTRADOR   │\n        │   (AI Agent)    │\n        └────────┬────────┘\n                 │\n    ┌────────────┼────────────┐\n    │            │            │\n┌───▼───┐   ┌───▼───┐   ┌───▼────┐\n│Analyze│   │Clean  │   │Generate│\n│Agent  │   │Agent  │   │Agent   │\n└───┬───┘   └───┬───┘   └───┬────┘\n    │           │           │\n    └───────────┼───────────┘\n                │\n        ┌───────▼────────┐\n        │    OUTPUTS     │\n        │ • Grafo        │\n        │ • Clusters     │\n        │ • Prompts      │\n        │ • Dashboard    │\n        └────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\nVou criar o sistema completo agora.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_microsoft\">\n# Microsoft Learn MCP Server\r\n\r\nThis server gives structured access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation via three tools:\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_search\r\nSearch official documentation and return up to 10 concise, high-quality content chunks (max 500 tokens each), including title, URL, and excerpt.\r\n\r\n- Use first to get a quick, reliable overview\r\n- Ideal for grounding answers in Microsoft knowledge\r\n\r\n### microsoft_code_sample_search\r\nSearch for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn documentation and return up to 20 relevant, high-quality code samples.\r\n\r\n- Use when you need to provide sample Microsoft/Azure related code in your answers.  \r\n- Ideal for generating code snippets or practical implementation examples.  \r\n- Optional parameter `language` can filter results. \r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_fetch\r\nFetch and convert full Microsoft documentation pages to markdown.\r\n\r\n- Use after search when you need full content from a specific URL\r\n- Required for detailed tutorials, troubleshooting, prerequisites, code samples, or when search results are incomplete or outdated\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days after approval.\n\n# Please provide the necessary details so we can proceed with resolving this issue for you.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n1. 📖 Try our [Getting Started Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide) or learn about [Building Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/)\n2. 🔌 Explore over 100 [Detailed Samples](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/detailed-samples)\n3. 💡 Learn about core Semantic Kernel [Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/kernel)\n\n### API References\n\n- [C# API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel?view=semantic-kernel-dotnet)\n- [Python API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/semantic-kernel/semantic_kernel?view=semantic-kernel-python)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n- **Authentication Errors**: Check that your API key environment variables are correctly set\n- **Model Availability**: Verify your Azure OpenAI deployment or OpenAI model access\n\n### Getting Help\n\n- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/issues) for known problems\n- Search the [Discord community](https://aka.ms/SKDiscord) for solutions\n- Include your SDK version and full error messages when asking for help\n\nWe welcome your contributions and suggestions to the SK community!

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI. Você pode otimizar seu prompt usando este código ou usar o otimizador [em nosso playground!](https://platform.openai.com/playground/prompts)\n\nPergunte ao ChatGPT\n\n**Estrutura do**  \nlivro de receitas Este caderno segue esta estrutura:\n\n- [Passo 1. Visão geral do sistema](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#1-system-overview) - Saiba como funciona o sistema de otimização imediata\n- [Etapa 2. Modelos de dados](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#2-data-models) - Entenda as estruturas de dados usadas pelo sistema\n- [Etapa 3. Definindo os agentes](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#3-defining-the-agents) - Veja os agentes que analisam e melhoram os prompts\n- [Etapa 4. Avaliações](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-using-evaluations-to-arrive-at-these-agents) - Use o Evals para verificar nossa escolha e instruções de modelo de agente\n- [Etapa 5. Executar fluxo de trabalho de otimização](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-run-optimization-workflow) - Veja como o fluxo de trabalho entrega os prompts\n- [Etapa 6. Exemplos](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#5-examples) - Explore exemplos reais de otimização imediata\n\n**Pré-requisitos**\n\n- O pacote Python `openai`\n- O pacote `openai-agents`\n- Uma chave de API OpenAI definida como em suas variáveis de ambiente `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n\n## 1\\. Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta. O fluxo de trabalho principal consiste em várias execuções dos agentes em paralelo para processar e otimizar prompts com eficiência.\n\n```\ndef _normalize_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n\n    \"\"\"Convert list of pydantic message models to JSON-serializable dicts.\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    for m in messages:\n\n        if hasattr(m, \"model_dump\"):\n\n            result.append(m.model_dump())\n\n        elif isinstance(m, dict) and \"role\" in m and \"content\" in m:\n\n            result.append({\"role\": str(m[\"role\"]), \"content\": str(m[\"content\"])})\n\n    return result\n\nasync def optimize_prompt_parallel(\n\n    developer_message: str,\n\n    messages: List[\"ChatMessage\"],\n\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Runs contradiction, format, and few-shot checkers in parallel,\n\n    then rewrites the prompt/examples if needed.\n\n    Returns a unified dict suitable for an API or endpoint.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with trace(\"optimize_prompt_workflow\"):\n\n        # 1.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3.

Keep ≤10 best-res.\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Successful Output: Emit a minified JSON object with the following fields and types (order not enforced):\n  - name: string\n  - brand: string\n  - sku: string\n  - price: object with:\n    - value: number\n    - currency: string\n  - images: array of string URLs\n  - sizes: array of strings (each including a unit tag, e.g., \"37 EU\")\n  - materials: array of strings\n  - care_instructions: string\n  - features: array of strings\n\nExample:\n{\"name\":\"Product Name\",\"brand\":\"Brand\",\"sku\":\"SKU123\",\"price\":{\"value\":1299.00,\"currency\":\"EUR\"},\"images\":[\"https://example.com/image1.jpg\",\"https://example.com/image2.jpg\"],\"sizes\":[\"37 EU\",\"38 EU\"],\"materials\":[\"Cotton\",\"Polyester\"],\"care_instructions\":\"Machine wash cold\",\"features\":[\"Feature 1\",\"Feature 2\"]}\n\n- If any required field is missing, return:\n  {\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\n  (Where <field> is the missing required field name.)\n```\n\nIsso demonstra como o sistema pode detectar e resolver contradições críticas que podem levar a saídas inconsistentes ou confusão para o modelo.\n\n### Exemplo 2: Corrigindo inconsistências entre exemplos de prompt e poucos disparos\n\n```\nasync def example_fewshot_fix():\n\n    prompt = \"Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).\"\n\n    \n\n    messages = [\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest US city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"New York City\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest UK city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\"city\\\":\\\"London\\\",\\\"population\\\":9541000}\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples before optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    print()\n\n    \n\n    # Call the optimization API\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [ChatMessage(**m) for m in messages])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Inconsistency found:\", result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    \n\n    # Show the optimized few-shot examples\n\n    optimized_messages = result[\"new_messages\"]\n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples after optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_fewshot_fix()\n```\n\n```\nFew-shot examples before optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: New York City\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n\nInconsistency found: The response 'New York City' does not use JSON format and is missing the required keys \\`city\\` and \\`population\\` as stated in the rule 'Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).'\n\nFew-shot examples after optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"New York City\",\"population\":8468000}\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n```\n\nThis is particularly important because few-shot examples have a strong influence on how models respond. If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n\n2. For each chunk:\n\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \"≥150 C\").\n\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

This tool will first detect compatible build tools and JDKs installed on the local machine automatically if they are not provided in the 'plan.md'; \n3. This tool will throw an exception to ask user to provide them manually if not detected.\n Be careful: \n- If the user provides any information in the conversation, you MUST make sure to write it into the appropriate place in 'plan.md' by yourself first because this tool only reads all information from 'plan.md'. \n- You MUST re-invoke this tool for these changes to take effect whether the user manually modifies 'plan.md' or you modify it. This tool should only be invoked during an upgrade process.",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI.

Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3.

Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3.

If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1.

Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_microsoft\">\n# Microsoft Learn MCP Server\r\n\r\nThis server gives structured access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation via three tools:\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_search\r\nSearch official documentation and return up to 10 concise, high-quality content chunks (max 500 tokens each), including title, URL, and excerpt.\r\n\r\n- Use first to get a quick, reliable overview\r\n- Ideal for grounding answers in Microsoft knowledge\r\n\r\n### microsoft_code_sample_search\r\nSearch for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn documentation and return up to 20 relevant, high-quality code samples.\r\n\r\n- Use when you need to provide sample Microsoft/Azure related code in your answers.  \r\n- Ideal for generating code snippets or practical implementation examples.  \r\n- Optional parameter `language` can filter results. \r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_fetch\r\nFetch and convert full Microsoft documentation pages to markdown.\r\n\r\n- Use after search when you need full content from a specific URL\r\n- Required for detailed tutorials, troubleshooting, prerequisites, code samples, or when search results are incomplete or outdated\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies.

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI.

Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta. O fluxo de trabalho principal consiste em várias execuções dos agentes em paralelo para processar e otimizar prompts com eficiência.\n\n```\ndef _normalize_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n\n    \"\"\"Convert list of pydantic message models to JSON-serializable dicts.\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    for m in messages:\n\n        if hasattr(m, \"model_dump\"):\n\n            result.append(m.model_dump())\n\n        elif isinstance(m, dict) and \"role\" in m and \"content\" in m:\n\n            result.append({\"role\": str(m[\"role\"]), \"content\": str(m[\"content\"])})\n\n    return result\n\nasync def optimize_prompt_parallel(\n\n    developer_message: str,\n\n    messages: List[\"ChatMessage\"],\n\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Runs contradiction, format, and few-shot checkers in parallel,\n\n    then rewrites the prompt/examples if needed.\n\n    Returns a unified dict suitable for an API or endpoint.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with trace(\"optimize_prompt_workflow\"):\n\n        # 1.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\. Exemplos\n\nVamos ver o sistema de otimização em ação com alguns exemplos práticos.\n\n### Exemplo 1: Corrigindo contradições\n\n```\nasync def example_contradiction():\n\n    # A prompt with contradictory instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Quick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \n\nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \n\nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n\n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n\n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n\n3. Visible DOM fallback (class hints: \"product-name\", \"price\")\n\n** Rules:**  \n\n- If *any* required field is missing, short-circuit with: \\`{\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\\`.\n\n- Prices: Numeric with dot decimal; strip non-digits (e.g., \"1.299,00 EUR\" → 1299.00 + \"EUR\").\n\n- Deduplicate images differing only by query string. Keep ≤10 best-res.\n\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n**Sample skeleton (minified):**\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n\n{\"name\":\"\",\"brand\":\"\",\"sku\":\"\",\"price\":{\"value\":0,\"currency\":\"USD\"},\"images\":[\"\"],\"sizes\":[],\"materials\":[],\"care_instructions\":\"\",\"features\":[]}\n\nNote: It is acceptable to output null for any missing field instead of an error ###\"\"\"\n\n    \n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Contradiction issues:\")\n\n        print(result[\"contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n        \n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_contradiction()\n```\n\n```\nContradiction issues:\nThere is a contradiction between the rule that says to short-circuit and output an error if *any* required field is missing ('{\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}') and the final note which states that it is acceptable to output null for any missing field instead of an error. Both behaviors cannot be followed simultaneously when a required field is missing.\n\nOptimized prompt:\nQuick-Start Card — Product Parser\n\nGoal  \nDigest raw HTML of an e-commerce product detail page and emit **concise, minified JSON** describing the item.\n\n**Required fields:**  \nname | brand | sku | price.value | price.currency | images[] | sizes[] | materials[] | care_instructions | features[]\n\n**Extraction priority:**  \n1. schema.org/JSON-LD blocks  \n2. <meta> & microdata tags  \n3. Visible DOM fallback (class hints: \"product-name\", \"price\")\n\n**Rules:**  \n- If *any* required field is missing, short-circuit and output: \\`{\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\\`\n- Prices: Numeric with dot decimal; strip non-digits (e.g., \"1.299,00 EUR\" → 1299.00 + \"EUR\").\n- Deduplicate images differing only by query string. Keep ≤10 best-res.\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Successful Output: Emit a minified JSON object with the following fields and types (order not enforced):\n  - name: string\n  - brand: string\n  - sku: string\n  - price: object with:\n    - value: number\n    - currency: string\n  - images: array of string URLs\n  - sizes: array of strings (each including a unit tag, e.g., \"37 EU\")\n  - materials: array of strings\n  - care_instructions: string\n  - features: array of strings\n\nExample:\n{\"name\":\"Product Name\",\"brand\":\"Brand\",\"sku\":\"SKU123\",\"price\":{\"value\":1299.00,\"currency\":\"EUR\"},\"images\":[\"https://example.com/image1.jpg\",\"https://example.com/image2.jpg\"],\"sizes\":[\"37 EU\",\"38 EU\"],\"materials\":[\"Cotton\",\"Polyester\"],\"care_instructions\":\"Machine wash cold\",\"features\":[\"Feature 1\",\"Feature 2\"]}\n\n- If any required field is missing, return:\n  {\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\n  (Where <field> is the missing required field name.)\n```\n\nIsso demonstra como o sistema pode detectar e resolver contradições críticas que podem levar a saídas inconsistentes ou confusão para o modelo.\n\n### Exemplo 2: Corrigindo inconsistências entre exemplos de prompt e poucos disparos\n\n```\nasync def example_fewshot_fix():\n\n    prompt = \"Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).\"\n\n    \n\n    messages = [\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest US city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"New York City\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest UK city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\"city\\\":\\\"London\\\",\\\"population\\\":9541000}\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples before optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    print()\n\n    \n\n    # Call the optimization API\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [ChatMessage(**m) for m in messages])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Inconsistency found:\", result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    \n\n    # Show the optimized few-shot examples\n\n    optimized_messages = result[\"new_messages\"]\n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples after optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_fewshot_fix()\n```\n\n```\nFew-shot examples before optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: New York City\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n\nInconsistency found: The response 'New York City' does not use JSON format and is missing the required keys \\`city\\` and \\`population\\` as stated in the rule 'Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).'\n\nFew-shot examples after optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"New York City\",\"population\":8468000}\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n```\n\nThis is particularly important because few-shot examples have a strong influence on how models respond. If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1.

Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_microsoft\">\n# Microsoft Learn MCP Server\r\n\r\nThis server gives structured access to official Microsoft and Azure documentation via three tools:\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_search\r\nSearch official documentation and return up to 10 concise, high-quality content chunks (max 500 tokens each), including title, URL, and excerpt.\r\n\r\n- Use first to get a quick, reliable overview\r\n- Ideal for grounding answers in Microsoft knowledge\r\n\r\n### microsoft_code_sample_search\r\nSearch for code snippets and examples in official Microsoft Learn documentation and return up to 20 relevant, high-quality code samples.\r\n\r\n- Use when you need to provide sample Microsoft/Azure related code in your answers.  \r\n- Ideal for generating code snippets or practical implementation examples.  \r\n- Optional parameter `language` can filter results. \r\n\r\n### microsoft_docs_fetch\r\nFetch and convert full Microsoft documentation pages to markdown.\r\n\r\n- Use after search when you need full content from a specific URL\r\n- Required for detailed tutorials, troubleshooting, prerequisites, code samples, or when search results are incomplete or outdated\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1. Use `microsoft_docs_search` to find relevant documents.\r\n2. If you need code examples or practical snippets, use `microsoft_code_sample_search`.\r\n3. If deeper or complete information is needed, use `microsoft_docs_fetch`.\r\n\r\n**Search gives breadth. Code Sample Search gives practical examples.

This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days after approval.\n\n# Please provide the necessary details so we can proceed with resolving this issue for you.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n1. 📖 Try our [Getting Started Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide) or learn about [Building Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/)\n2. 🔌 Explore over 100 [Detailed Samples](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/detailed-samples)\n3. 💡 Learn about core Semantic Kernel [Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/kernel)\n\n### API References\n\n- [C# API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel?view=semantic-kernel-dotnet)\n- [Python API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/semantic-kernel/semantic_kernel?view=semantic-kernel-python)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n- **Authentication Errors**: Check that your API key environment variables are correctly set\n- **Model Availability**: Verify your Azure OpenAI deployment or OpenAI model access\n\n### Getting Help\n\n- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/issues) for known problems\n- Search the [Discord community](https://aka.ms/SKDiscord) for solutions\n- Include your SDK version and full error messages when asking for help\n\nWe welcome your contributions and suggestions to the SK community!

Mesmo usuários experientes podem inadvertidamente introduzir contradições, ambiguidades ou inconsistências que levam a resultados abaixo do ideal. O sistema demonstrado aqui ajuda a identificar e corrigir problemas comuns, resultando em prompts mais confiáveis e eficazes.\n\nO processo de otimização usa uma abordagem multiagente com agentes de IA especializados colaborando para analisar e reescrever prompts. O sistema identifica e resolve automaticamente vários tipos de problemas comuns:\n\n- **Contradições nas instruções imediatas**\n- **Especificações de formato** ausentes ou pouco claras\n- **Inconsistências** entre o prompt e os exemplos de poucos disparos\n\n---\n\n**Objetivo**: Este livro de receitas demonstra as melhores práticas para usar o Agents SDK junto com o Evals para criar uma versão inicial do sistema de otimização de prompt da OpenAI. Você pode otimizar seu prompt usando este código ou usar o otimizador [em nosso playground!](https://platform.openai.com/playground/prompts)\n\nPergunte ao ChatGPT\n\n**Estrutura do**  \nlivro de receitas Este caderno segue esta estrutura:\n\n- [Passo 1. Visão geral do sistema](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#1-system-overview) - Saiba como funciona o sistema de otimização imediata\n- [Etapa 2. Modelos de dados](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#2-data-models) - Entenda as estruturas de dados usadas pelo sistema\n- [Etapa 3. Definindo os agentes](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#3-defining-the-agents) - Veja os agentes que analisam e melhoram os prompts\n- [Etapa 4. Avaliações](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-using-evaluations-to-arrive-at-these-agents) - Use o Evals para verificar nossa escolha e instruções de modelo de agente\n- [Etapa 5. Executar fluxo de trabalho de otimização](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#4-run-optimization-workflow) - Veja como o fluxo de trabalho entrega os prompts\n- [Etapa 6. Exemplos](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/#5-examples) - Explore exemplos reais de otimização imediata\n\n**Pré-requisitos**\n\n- O pacote Python `openai`\n- O pacote `openai-agents`\n- Uma chave de API OpenAI definida como em suas variáveis de ambiente `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n\n## 1\\. Visão geral do sistema\n\nO sistema de otimização de prompt usa uma abordagem multiagente colaborativa para analisar e melhorar os prompts. Cada agente é especializado em detectar ou reescrever um tipo específico de problema:\n\n1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Verifica o prompt em busca de contradições lógicas ou instruções impossíveis, como \"usar apenas números positivos\" e \"incluir exemplos negativos\" no mesmo prompt.\n2. **Verificador de formato**: identifica quando um prompt espera uma saída estruturada (como JSON, CSV ou Markdown), mas não especifica claramente os requisitos exatos de formato. Esse agente garante que todos os campos, tipos de dados e regras de formatação necessários sejam definidos explicitamente.\n3. **Verificador de consistência de poucos tiros**: examina exemplos de conversas para garantir que as respostas do assistente realmente sigam as regras especificadas no prompt. Isso detecta incompatibilidades entre o que o prompt requer e o que os exemplos demonstram.\n4. **Dev-Rewriter**: depois que os problemas são identificados, esse agente reescreve o prompt para resolver contradições e esclarecer as especificações de formato, preservando a intenção original.\n5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: atualiza respostas de exemplo inconsistentes para se alinhar às regras no prompt, garantindo que todos os exemplos estejam em conformidade com o novo prompt do desenvolvedor.\n\nTrabalhando juntos, esses agentes podem identificar e corrigir sistematicamente problemas em prompts.\n\n```\n# Import required modules\n\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nimport asyncio\n\nimport json\n\nimport os\n\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nfrom typing import Any, List, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_client, trace\n\nopenai_client: AsyncOpenAI | None = None\n\ndef _get_openai_client() -> AsyncOpenAI:\n\n    global openai_client\n\n    if openai_client is None:\n\n        openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(\n\n            api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-api-key\"),\n\n        )\n\n    return openai_client\n\nset_default_openai_client(_get_openai_client())\n```\n\n## 2\\. Modelos de dados\n\nPara facilitar a comunicação estruturada entre os agentes, o sistema utiliza modelos Pydantic para definir o formato esperado para entradas e saídas. Esses modelos Pydantic ajudam a validar dados e garantir a consistência em todo o fluxo de trabalho.\n\nOs modelos de dados incluem:\n\n1. **Função** - Uma enumeração para funções de mensagem (usuário/assistente)\n2. **ChatMessage** - Representa uma única mensagem em uma conversa\n3. **Problemas** - Modelo base para relatar problemas detectados\n4. **FewShotIssues** - Modelo estendido que adiciona sugestões de reescrita para mensagens de exemplo\n5. **MessagesOutput** - Contém mensagens de conversa otimizadas\n6. **DevRewriteOutput** - Contém o prompt do desenvolvedor aprimorado\n\nO uso do Pydantic permite que o sistema valide se todos os dados estão em conformidade com o formato esperado em cada etapa do processo.\n\n```\nclass Role(str, Enum):\n\n    \"\"\"Role enum for chat messages.\"\"\"\n\n    user = \"user\"\n\n    assistant = \"assistant\"\n\nclass ChatMessage(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Single chat message used in few-shot examples.\"\"\"\n\n    role: Role\n\n    content: str\n\nclass Issues(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by checkers.\"\"\"\n\n    has_issues: bool\n\n    issues: List[str]\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"Issues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[])\n\nclass FewShotIssues(Issues):\n\n    \"\"\"Output for few-shot contradiction detector including optional rewrite suggestions.\"\"\"\n\n    rewrite_suggestions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n    \n\n    @classmethod\n\n    def no_issues(cls) -> \"FewShotIssues\":\n\n        return cls(has_issues=False, issues=[], rewrite_suggestions=[])\n\nclass MessagesOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Structured output returned by \\`rewrite_messages_agent\\`.\"\"\"\n\n    messages: list[ChatMessage]\n\nclass DevRewriteOutput(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"Rewriter returns the cleaned-up developer prompt.\"\"\"\n\n    new_developer_message: str\n```\n\n## 3\\. Definindo os Agentes\n\nNesta seção, criamos agentes de IA especializados usando a classe do pacote. Observar essas definições de agente revela várias práticas recomendadas para criar instruções de IA eficazes:`Agent` `openai-agents`\n\n### Práticas recomendadas em instruções do agente\n\n1. **Definição de escopo clara**: cada agente tem um propósito estritamente definido com limites explícitos. Por exemplo, o verificador de contradições se concentra apenas em \"autocontradições genuínas\" e afirma explicitamente que \"sobreposições ou redundâncias não são contradições\".\n2. **Processo passo a passo**: as instruções fornecem uma metodologia clara, como a forma como o verificador de formato primeiro categoriza a tarefa antes de analisar os requisitos de formato.\n3. **Definições explícitas**: Os termos-chave são definidos com precisão para evitar ambiguidade. O verificador de consistência de poucos disparos inclui uma \"Rubrica de Conformidade\" detalhada explicando exatamente o que constitui conformidade.\n4. **Configuração de limite**: As instruções especificam o que o agente NÃO deve fazer. O verificador de poucos tiros lista explicitamente o que está \"fora do escopo\" para evitar problemas de sinalização excessiva.\n5. **Requisitos de saída estruturada**: cada agente tem um formato de saída estritamente definido com exemplos, garantindo consistência no pipeline de otimização.\n\nEsses princípios criam agentes confiáveis e focados que trabalham efetivamente juntos no sistema de otimização. Abaixo, vemos as definições completas do agente com suas instruções detalhadas.\n\n```\ndev_contradiction_checker = Agent(\n\n    name=\"contradiction_detector\",\n\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n\n    output_type=Issues,\n\n    instructions=\"\"\"\n\n    You are **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**.\n\n    Goal\n\n    Detect *genuine* self-contradictions or impossibilities **inside** the developer prompt supplied in the variable \\`DEVELOPER_MESSAGE\\`.\n\n    Definitions\n\n    • A contradiction = two clauses that cannot both be followed.\n\n    • Overlaps or redundancies in the DEVELOPER_MESSAGE are *not* contradictions.\n\n    What you MUST do\n\n    1.

Usando avaliações para chegar a esses agentes\n\nVamos ver como usamos o OpenAI Evals para ajustar as instruções do agente e escolher o modelo correto a ser usado. Para fazer isso, construímos um conjunto de exemplos de ouro: cada um contém mensagens originais (mensagem do desenvolvedor + mensagem do usuário/assistente) e as alterações que nosso fluxo de trabalho de otimização deve fazer. Aqui estão dois exemplos de pares dourados que usamos:\n\n```\n[\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Always answer in **English**.\\nNunca respondas en inglés.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Always answer **in English**.\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"¿Qué hora es?\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"Developer message simultaneously insists on English and forbids it.\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  {\n\n    \"focus\": \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\",\n\n    \"input_payload\": {\n\n      \"developer_message\": \"Respond with **only 'yes' or 'no'** – no explanations.\",\n\n      \"messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes, because wavelengths …\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Yes.\"\n\n        }\n\n      ]\n\n    },\n\n    \"golden_output\": {\n\n      \"changes\": true,\n\n      \"new_developer_message\": \"Respond with **only** the single word \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\",\n\n      \"new_messages\": [\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is the sky blue?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n\n          \"content\": \"Is water wet?\"\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n          \"content\": \"yes\"\n\n        }\n\n      ],\n\n      \"contradiction_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"few_shot_contradiction_issues\": \"Assistant examples include explanations despite instruction not to.\",\n\n      \"format_issues\": \"\",\n\n      \"general_improvements\": \"\"\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n]\n```\n\nA partir dessas 20 saídas douradas rotuladas manualmente que cobrem uma variedade de problemas de contradição, poucos problemas de tiro, problemas de formato, nenhum problema ou uma combinação de problemas, construímos um classificador de verificação de string python para verificar duas coisas: se um problema foi detectado para cada par dourado e se o problema detectado correspondia ao esperado. A partir desse sinal, ajustamos as instruções do agente e qual modelo usar para maximizar nossa precisão nessa avaliação. Chegamos ao modelo 4.1 como um equilíbrio entre precisão, custo e velocidade. Os prompts específicos que usamos também seguem o guia de prompts 4.1. Como você pode ver, alcançamos os rótulos corretos em todos os 20 resultados de ouro: identificando os problemas certos e evitando falsos positivos.\n\n![Precisão para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig1.png)\n\n![Avaliação para o conjunto dourado](https://cookbook.openai.com/images/optimizepromptfig2.png)\n\n## 5\\. Execute o fluxo de trabalho de otimização\n\nVamos nos aprofundar em como o sistema de otimização realmente funciona de ponta a ponta. O fluxo de trabalho principal consiste em várias execuções dos agentes em paralelo para processar e otimizar prompts com eficiência.\n\n```\ndef _normalize_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n\n    \"\"\"Convert list of pydantic message models to JSON-serializable dicts.\"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    for m in messages:\n\n        if hasattr(m, \"model_dump\"):\n\n            result.append(m.model_dump())\n\n        elif isinstance(m, dict) and \"role\" in m and \"content\" in m:\n\n            result.append({\"role\": str(m[\"role\"]), \"content\": str(m[\"content\"])})\n\n    return result\n\nasync def optimize_prompt_parallel(\n\n    developer_message: str,\n\n    messages: List[\"ChatMessage\"],\n\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Runs contradiction, format, and few-shot checkers in parallel,\n\n    then rewrites the prompt/examples if needed.\n\n    Returns a unified dict suitable for an API or endpoint.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with trace(\"optimize_prompt_workflow\"):\n\n        # 1.

Esse agente depende das saídas de:`dev_rewriter`\n\t- `dev_contradiction_checker` (a variável) `cd_issues`\n\t- `format_checker` (a variável) `fi_issues`\n2. **Exemplo de regravação (condicional):** o agente só é executado se forem detectadas inconsistências de exemplo. Este agente depende de:`fewshot_rewriter`\n\t- O prompt reescrito (deve ser feito após a regravação do prompt)\n\t- As mensagens originais\n\t- As questões de poucos tiros (a variável) `fs_issues`\n\n## 6\\.

Keep ≤10 best-res.\n- Sizes: Ensure unit tag (\"EU\", \"US\") and ascending sort.\n- Materials: Title-case and collapse synonyms (e.g., \"polyester 100%\" → \"Polyester\").\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Successful Output: Emit a minified JSON object with the following fields and types (order not enforced):\n  - name: string\n  - brand: string\n  - sku: string\n  - price: object with:\n    - value: number\n    - currency: string\n  - images: array of string URLs\n  - sizes: array of strings (each including a unit tag, e.g., \"37 EU\")\n  - materials: array of strings\n  - care_instructions: string\n  - features: array of strings\n\nExample:\n{\"name\":\"Product Name\",\"brand\":\"Brand\",\"sku\":\"SKU123\",\"price\":{\"value\":1299.00,\"currency\":\"EUR\"},\"images\":[\"https://example.com/image1.jpg\",\"https://example.com/image2.jpg\"],\"sizes\":[\"37 EU\",\"38 EU\"],\"materials\":[\"Cotton\",\"Polyester\"],\"care_instructions\":\"Machine wash cold\",\"features\":[\"Feature 1\",\"Feature 2\"]}\n\n- If any required field is missing, return:\n  {\"error\": \"FIELD_MISSING:<field>\"}\n  (Where <field> is the missing required field name.)\n```\n\nIsso demonstra como o sistema pode detectar e resolver contradições críticas que podem levar a saídas inconsistentes ou confusão para o modelo.\n\n### Exemplo 2: Corrigindo inconsistências entre exemplos de prompt e poucos disparos\n\n```\nasync def example_fewshot_fix():\n\n    prompt = \"Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).\"\n\n    \n\n    messages = [\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest US city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"New York City\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Largest UK city?\"},\n\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{\\\"city\\\":\\\"London\\\",\\\"population\\\":9541000}\"}\n\n    ]\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples before optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    print()\n\n    \n\n    # Call the optimization API\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [ChatMessage(**m) for m in messages])\n\n    \n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"]:\n\n        print(\"Inconsistency found:\", result[\"few_shot_contradiction_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    \n\n    # Show the optimized few-shot examples\n\n    optimized_messages = result[\"new_messages\"]\n\n    print(\"Few-shot examples after optimization:\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[0]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[1]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"User: {optimized_messages[2]['content']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Assistant: {optimized_messages[3]['content']}\")\n\n    \n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_fewshot_fix()\n```\n\n```\nFew-shot examples before optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: New York City\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n\nInconsistency found: The response 'New York City' does not use JSON format and is missing the required keys \\`city\\` and \\`population\\` as stated in the rule 'Respond **only** with JSON using keys \\`city\\` (string) and \\`population\\` (integer).'\n\nFew-shot examples after optimization:\nUser: Largest US city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"New York City\",\"population\":8468000}\nUser: Largest UK city?\nAssistant: {\"city\":\"London\",\"population\":9541000}\n```\n\nThis is particularly important because few-shot examples have a strong influence on how models respond. If examples don't follow the stated rules, the model may learn to ignore those rules in favor of mimicking the examples. By ensuring consistency between the prompt instructions and examples, the optimization system creats a more reliable prompt.\n\n### Example 3: Clarifying Formats in a Longer Prompt\n\n```\nasync def example_format_issue():\n\n    # A prompt with unclear or inconsistent formatting instructions\n\n    prompt = \"\"\"Task → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n\n2. For each chunk:\n\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \"≥150 C\").\n\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\nOutput should follow a Markdown template:\n\n- A summary section.\n\n- A glossary section with the marked terms and their definitions.\n\nCorner Cases:\n\n- If the claim is over 5 kB, respond with CLAIM_TOO_LARGE.\n\n- If claim text is already plain English, skip glossary and state no complex terms detected.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\"\"\"\n\n    # Call the optimization API to check for format issues\n\n    result = await optimize_prompt_parallel(prompt, [])\n\n    # Display the results\n\n    if result.get(\"format_issues\"):\n\n        print(\"Format issues found:\", result[\"format_issues\"])\n\n        print()\n\n    print(\"Optimized prompt:\")\n\n    print(result[\"new_developer_message\"])\n\n# Run the example\n\nawait example_format_issue()\n```\n\n```\nFormat issues found: Output must follow a precise Markdown template, but the expected structure (headers, formatting) for the summary and glossary sections is not fully specified.\nAmbiguity if output should be a Markdown string or a structured object containing Markdown—data type of output is implicit.\nNo explicit ordering instruction for the summary and glossary sections—potentially ambiguous.\nWord count limit (200 words) is mentioned for the summary but not for the glossary section—scope unclear.\nNo specific format for CLAIM_TOO_LARGE error or for indicating 'no complex terms'—should these be Markdown or plaintext?\n\nOptimized prompt:\nTask → Translate dense patent claims into 200-word lay summaries with a glossary.\n\nOperating Steps:\n1. Split the claim at semicolons, \"wherein\", or numbered sub-clauses.\n2. For each chunk:\n   a) Identify its purpose.\n   b) Replace technical nouns with everyday analogies.\n   c) Keep quantitative limits intact (e.g., \">=150 C\").\n3. Flag uncommon science terms with asterisks, and later define them.\n4. Re-assemble into a flowing paragraph; do **not** broaden or narrow the claim’s scope.\n5. Omit boilerplate if its removal does not alter legal meaning.\n\n## Output Format\n- All outputs must be provided as a Markdown string.\n- If the claim exceeds 5 kB, respond only with the text: \\`CLAIM_TOO_LARGE\\` (no Markdown formatting).\n- If the claim is already in plain English, output the following Markdown:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <summary text>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  No complex terms detected.\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- Otherwise, follow this Markdown template:\n  \n  \\`\\`\\`markdown\n  ## Summary\n  <Lay summary of the claim (max 200 words)>\n  \n  ## Glossary\n  - *Term1*: Definition of Term1\n  - *Term2*: Definition of Term2\n  ...\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- The 'Summary' section comes before the 'Glossary' section in all cases.\n- The word count limit (200 words) applies to the summary only; the glossary has no length limit.\n\nRemember: You are *not* providing legal advice—this is for internal comprehension only.\n```\n\nThis example highlights how the format checker identifies and resolves ambiguous format specifications. The prompt requested a Markdown output and the optimization flow significantly improved these format specifications.\n````"
